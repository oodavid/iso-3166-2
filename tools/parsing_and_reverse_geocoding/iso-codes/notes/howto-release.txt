How to release a new version of iso-codes
=========================================

Make sure you have all the latest updates and no stale files
in your working copy. The best way to achieve this is to get
a fresh checkout from the git server.
$ mkdir release
$ cd release
$ git clone ssh://<user>@git.debian.org/git/iso-codes/iso-codes.git

Update the version number in configure.ac, also update the ChangeLog
with the current release number, your name, and the date.
Commit the changes.
$ git commit -a -m "Prepare next release"

Update all automatically generated files (configure, Makefiles, etc.)
and commit.
$ autoreconf --install --symlink
$ git commit -a -m "Update automatically generated files"

Create the Makefiles.
$ ./configure

Update all .po files (including the automatic update of the
sr@latin locale) and commit.
$ make update-po
$ git commit -a -m "Refresh .po files"

Create an annotated and GPG-signed tag for the next release.
Please respect the following release numbering scheme:

- Major version: use this for data organisation changes (like the
  switch to XML, or incompatible changes in the XML files like the
  removal of a field)
- Level 1 minor version: use this when one of the ISO lists is updated
  or for compatible changes to the XML files, like the addition of
  a field
- Level 2 minor version: use this when only translations are updated.
  If you increment the Level 1 minor version, omit the second level
  minor version. Example: 1.2.5 -> 1.3, not 1.3.0

$ git tag -s -m "iso-codes MAJOR.MINOR1.MINOR2" iso-codes/MAJOR.MINOR1.MINOR2

Use the Makefile target "release" for creating checked tarballs.
$ make release

Use the Makefile target "sign-release" to sign the tarballs.
$ make sign-release

Upload the tarballs and your signatures to the FTP area of Alioth.
$ ALIOTH_USERNAME=<yourname> make upload

Please do not remove previous versions from the FTP area of Alioth,
because they might still be needed by some distributions.

You can now clean up.
$ cd ..
$ rm -rf release/


How to release a new Debian revision
====================================

Check out the debian branch of iso-codes and merge the master branch.
$ git checkout debian
$ git merge master

Copy the ChangeLog entries which fix a bug in the Debian BTS to
debian/changelog and commit.
$ git commit debian/changelog

When you're ready to upload, create an annotated and GPG-signed tag
for the release.
$ git tag -s -m "Debian release 3.5.1-1" debian/3.5.1-1

Go back to the master branch.
$ git checkout master
